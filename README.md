Tutorial that I followed is [here](https://github.com/huffleman51/js-stack-from-scratch/blob/master/tutorial/09-travis-coveralls-heroku.md#readme).

## What I learned in this module

1. Travis CI is a popular continuous integration platform, free for open source projects.
1. If your project is hosted publicly on Github, integrating Travis is very simple. First, authenticate with your Github account on Travis, and add your repository.
1. Coveralls is a service that gives you a history and statistics of your test coverage.
